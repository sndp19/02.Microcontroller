# Problem Statement:

## Embedded C program to display a pattern on the LEDs.

 **Output Requirements:**

1)Consider 8 LEDs from the Board, these LEDs has to glow one by one as if a train bogie coming out of a tunnel every second (approx., none without timer implementation)from Left to Right as soon as the board is powered on or reset (Let’s call it as exit)

2)Once all LEDs are ON, the LEDs should switch OFF one by one as if the train bogie is entering inside a tunnel from Left to Right (Let’s call it as entry).

3)Once the exit and entry is complete , Change the direction of the train from Right to Left.

4)This process of changing direction has to be repeated between every exit and entry of the train.

** Inputs:**

No external inputs

Should be software controlled

**Output:**
